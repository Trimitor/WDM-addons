# Explanation of optional deps:
# Cartographer_Waypoints and Tomtom are there so I can link with their arrows properly.
# Cartographer_InstanceMaps: Cartographer is terrible. See cartographer_is_terrible.lua.
# Swatter really likes intercepting all error messages and not letting them through. Since I want to intercept my own messages, I go after Swatter so I can insert my hook earlier on.
# Tekticles is around because, if QH loads before it does, then QH doesn't use its custom fonts, and I think its custom fonts are pretty. There's probably a better solution to this, but it turns out I'm incredibly lazy, so, meh.
# UnicodeFont: see Tekticles
# ClearFont2: see Tekticles


# That is a pile of saved variables. Let me try to explain them better.
#
# Old data gathering:
# QuestHelper_SaveDate: Date of last shutdown.
# QuestHelper_Collector_Version: Originally part of the new system, now just hanging around until I believe it vanishing won't cause problems.
#
# New data gathering:
# QuestHelper_Collector: Most new data. In one huge horrible pile, but a *properly categorized* huge horrible pile
#
# Misc:
# QuestHelper_Pref: User preferences
# QuestHelper_UID: User unique ID
# QuestHelper_Errors: List of errors seen
#
# Everything under "Old data gathering" will go away once the new data gathering is in place. (note: they have mostly gone away)
#
# Per-character stuff needs to be consolidated as well, which will happen in some future version. I need to see how it handles *removing* variables. And yeah we're adding more per-character stuff already argharblrghab
